K-Loader is a tiny "Script Loader" : (Javascript , Stylesheet & Font Loader) Just by typing the name of dependencies, it can load and execute them in order .

You will not have to search for CDN Links in your html files 😎 Cool !

Using a script loader like K-Loader will improve the speed and quality of your code.

### HOW DO I USE "K-Loader" ?

1. Download K-Loader from Here (This Link) Or Use Our CDN
